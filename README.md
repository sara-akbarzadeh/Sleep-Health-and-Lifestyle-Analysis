# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis  

This project explores the relationship between sleep health and lifestyle factors using the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset** from Kaggle. Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **hypothesis testing**, we analyze how variables such as stress levels, physical activity, and BMI impact sleep quality. The findings provide insights into factors influencing sleep health and highlight potential areas for further research.
